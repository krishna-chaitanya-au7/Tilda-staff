# Progress Status

## What Works
- **Attendance Taking**: Basic presence/absence marking.
- **Status Options**: "Came Late", "Left Early", and "Reset" functionality implemented.
- **Time/Comment Input**: Dialog with native time picker working.
- **Realtime Updates**: Attendance changes reflect immediately.
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback on actions.

## What's Left to Build
- **Error Verification**: Confirming the "Failed to save event" fix works for all edge cases.

## Current Status
- **Attendance Options**: Feature parity with web version achieved (Late/Early/Reset).
- **Bug Fixes**: Addressed "Failed to save event" by handling temporary IDs.

## Known Issues
- None currently active (waiting for user verification on save error).
- Previous issues with `datetimepicker` import resolved.
