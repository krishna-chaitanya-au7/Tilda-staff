# Product Context

## Purpose
Tilda-staff is the mobile companion for staff members. It needs to provide feature parity with the web dashboard (bissfest_tool) regarding messaging and user profile management.

## User Experience
-   **Messaging**: Users should be able to manage conversations, view participants, and send rich media (images, polls) just like on the web.
-   **Profile**: Users need a dedicated space to view and update their personal information and securely log out.
